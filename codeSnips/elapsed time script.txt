You guys still love your complicated scripts/functions.

DE_calcElapsedTime =
{
_startDate = _this;
_elapsedTime = [];
{
	_elapsedTime pushBack (_x - (_startDate select _forEachIndex));
}forEach (date);
_elapsedTime;
};
That's all you need right there. It's small, it's light, it's cpu-friendly. Example usage:

startTime = date;
player addAction ["Calculated Elapsed Time",
{
hint str (startTime call DE_calcElapsedTime);
}, [], 6];
